# Quick Gulp Setup

I wanted to try out Gulp in comparison to Grunt. I generally like to build my site using SASS with Compass. Susy is my grid system of choice. I really like the speed of development Live Reload gives you. So i replicated it and it actually runs a lot faster. 

Im so pleased, I thought I would share it.

## Requirements
* Node JS and Ruby
* SASS, Compass and Susy gems
* Gulp
* Live Reload Chrome plugin

## Usage
* CD to the directory in your terminal
* ```npm install```
* ```gulp```

## Improvements
* Environments for test and production

## Problems?
